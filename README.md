Modelling and Forecasting Indian Stock Market Volatility

The models above predict volatility, or the direction of movement of stock prices, and not the returns generated by them. The volatility is plotted with the 
actual returns for understanding the direction of movement of stocks in that time period and not the magnitude. It can be seen when there is a positive spike in 
returns that means the prices made a huge jump, the volatility curve indicates it with movement upwards. The amount of upward or downward movement of the volatility 
curve is proportional to the spike or dip in the returns. We can clearly see that the returns curve, and predicted volatility curve move together. When there is 
fluctuation in returns the model is able to capture that by moving upwards or downwards, and when the returns are stable close to 0, the model is again able to capture 
that by stabilising itself with a smooth transition and not a spike.

The usability of this model is that the investors can make an informed investment decision by looking at the predicted volatility curve. If the curve has a sudden 
spike(movement upwards) or dip(downwards), they can make a decision to buy and short sell the stocks respectively, and if the curve smoothens over time, it is indicative 
of the fact that prices won't fluctuate a lot in that time frame.
